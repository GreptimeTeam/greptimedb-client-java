/**
 * Concurrency limit algorithm that adjusts the limit based on the gradient of change of the current average RTT and
 * a long term exponentially smoothed average RTT.  Unlike traditional congestion control algorithms we use average
 * instead of minimum since RPC methods can be very bursty due to various factors such as non-homogenous request
 * processing complexity as well as a wide distribution of data size.  We have also found that using minimum can result
 * in an bias towards an impractically low base RTT resulting in excessive load shedding.  An exponential decay is
 * applied to the base RTT so that the value is kept stable yet is allowed to adapt to long term changes in latency
 * characteristics.
 *
 * The core algorithm re-calculates the limit every sampling window (ex. 1 second) using the formula
 *
 *      // Calculate the gradient limiting to the range [0.5, 1.0] to filter outliers
 *      gradient = max(0.5, min(1.0, longtermRtt / currentRtt));
 *
 *      // Calculate the new limit by applying the gradient and allowing for some queuing
 *      newLimit = gradient * currentLimit + queueSize;
 *
 *      // Update the limit using a smoothing factor (default 0.2)
 *      newLimit = currentLimit * (1-smoothing) + newLimit * smoothing
 *
 * The limit can be in one of three main states
 *
 * 1.  Steady state
 *
 * In this state the average RTT is very stable and the current measurement whipsaws around this value, sometimes reducing
 * the limit, sometimes increasing it.
 *
 * 2.  Transition from steady state to load
 *
 * In this state either the RPS to latency has spiked. The gradient is {@literal <} 1.0 due to a growing request queue that
 * cannot be handled by the system. Excessive requests and rejected due to the low limit. The baseline RTT grows using
 * exponential decay but lags the current measurement, which keeps the gradient {@literal <} 1.0 and limit low.
 *
 * 3.  Transition from load to steady state
 *
 * In this state the system goes back to steady state after a prolonged period of excessive load.  Requests aren't rejected
 * and the sample RTT remains low. During this state the long term RTT may take some time to go back to normal and could
 * potentially be several multiples higher than the current RTT.
